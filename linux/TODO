Arch:
  - Python debugging in OSS Code? (without Pylance)
    - Seems ok, and it mentions Pylance in suggestions
  - VLC playing from Samba share

Debian:
  - OSS Code instead of VS Code?
  - Steam launching outside command line?

Server
  - Google Drive backup with rclone
    - And make it a service that runs regularly
      - or at least an alias
  - Apple Photos backup
    - Make it a service that runs at boot and does watch
      - How to re-authenticate when needed?
        - Seems like it's good for a couple of weeks, at least
      - At least make aliases of these
  - Gmail backup
    - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Isync ?

Backup latest KDE config files from Arch
  - Maybe better to make a list of which settings I change?
    - Feeling less good about just copying config files around
    - They seem to have a lot of other stuff that could mess things up
